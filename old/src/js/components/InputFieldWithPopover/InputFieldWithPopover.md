Allow to render [`<Input>`](#input) together with [`<Popover>`](#popover) component. Thanks to that you can present user
tooltips when he is hovering cursor above the input field.

You can pass all of the [`<Input>` props](#input) to the `<InputFieldWithPopover>` component. 

# Example
    (
      <InputFieldWithPopover
        tooltip="Some nice and helpfull text for the user" 
        placeholder="Please provide name"
      />
    )
